# Divi Builder Conditional Script and Style Loading
The plugin version of the Divi builder loads its scripts and styles on all page regardless of whether the builder is active on the current page or not.  This simple plugin checks to see if the builder is active on the current page and then allows these scripts and styles to only load when the builder is present.
